# Module_4
 Ive created a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across specific areas of financial analysis, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. I used historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. I then used this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 IndexLinks to an external site.).
